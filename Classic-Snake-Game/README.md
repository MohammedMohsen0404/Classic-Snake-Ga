# Classic Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ with a console interface. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats fruit, with the goal of avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The game speeds up and the play area decreases as the player progresses through levels.

## How to Play

- Use `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys to move the snake:
  - `w` to move up
  - `a` to move left
  - `s` to move down
  - `d` to move right
- Press `x` to exit the game at any time.

### Game Instructions

1. If you eat the food, the snake will grow longer.
2. If you touch the wall, you will lose.
3. If you bite yourself, you will lose.
4. The playing area decreases with each level.
5. The snake's speed increases with each level.
6. The level rises after eating two fruits.
