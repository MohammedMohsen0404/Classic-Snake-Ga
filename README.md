# Classic-Snake-Game-by-c-
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ with a console interface. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats fruit, with the goal of avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The game speeds up and the play area decreases as the player progresses through levels.
